# App Directory Guide

The [`app/`](mdc:app) directory is the main Django application containing core business logic:

- [`models.py`](mdc:app/models.py): Defines the database models.
- [`views.py`](mdc:app/views.py): Contains view functions and classes for handling HTTP requests.
- [`admin.py`](mdc:app/admin.py): Registers models for the Django admin interface.
- [`urls.py`](mdc:app/urls.py): URL routing for the app.
- [`tests.py`](mdc:app/tests.py): Test cases for the app.
- [`db_routers.py`](mdc:app/db_routers.py): Custom database routing logic.
- [`base.py`](mdc:app/base.py): Base classes or utilities (see file for details).
- [`migrations/`](mdc:app/migrations): Database migration files.

Use this guide to understand the responsibilities and entry points of the Django app.
